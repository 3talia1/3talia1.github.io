        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutTech"> I have been battling with my mental health since I was around 12. It took a toll on me physically and emotionally. My mental health journey has its ups and downs, some days are easier and some days are harder. Over the years, I've discovered different sources and outlets to help me cope.</h4>
        <h1 class="tech1">Music 🎧✩°｡⋆⸜</h1>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutTech1"> Using music to cope has helped me in numerous ways. As someone who doesn't know how to express themselves with words music helps me. Music helps me express my emotions and gives me courage to use my words to express myself. Lisenting to music not only is a form of expression but also puts me in a better mental health space.</h4>

        <h1 class="tech3">Journaling 📜☕🐻</h1>
        <h4 class="abiutTech3"> Journaling is such a simple task but has a huge effect on self expression. If you are somewhat like me and have a difficult time communicating, journaling is a great way to get all those emotions and feelings out. Journaling provides a way to process emotions. I personally enjoy journaling due to the fact that no one else will read it besides myself.</h4>
