        <h1 class="titleBen">Benefits of Self Care üå∑‚Äé‚ô°‚ÇäÀö</h1>
        <h2 class="listsBen"> Since the beginning of my self care journey I have recognized positive change in my behavior and my thought process. </h2>
        <h4 class="aboutBen">Before I started to focus on bettering myself I was a very negative person. I was bitter all the time and had an attitude problem. I was always caught up on the negative things happening in my life and never the positive. I was constantly feeding and surrounding myself with negative energy that I forogt to see the better in things. Ever since I shifted my mindset I've seen tremendous growth in my attitude. </h4>
        <h1 class="ben1"> Stress (‚óèÔ∏ø‚óè) </h1>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutBen1"> Since practicng self care I was constantly stressing over something weather that be school, work, or at home. I started to take a step back and realized life is never that deep and that I should enjoy it.  Ever since I had the mindset of not taking everything so serious and enjoying the present moment, I started to cherish my memories. I took a step back and I am starting to appreciate the little things in my life. There will always be negative aspects in life and that's okay. With the negatives there will also be positives. Instead of wasting so much energy focusing on the negatives, I focused on the positives. This wasn't always easy for me though. It took a while to rewire the way I think and stopped reacting negatively. </h4>

        <h1 class="ben2"> Getting to Know Yourself (·µî·¥•·µî)</h1>
        <h4 class="aboutben2"> I always wondered to myself the purpose of life. What were we put on the Earth to do? Ever since putting time and effort into bettering my mind and becoming a better person I have gotten the opportunity to reconnect with myself. A while ago, I completely lost sense of myself, what I liked to do, my values, and everything in between I began to seek validation from negative sources leading me back to being a negative person. My biggest realization is that I finally knew who I was and what made ME feel good. I'm more aware and understanding of my emotions and what I am feeling instead of just getting angry and going off on everybody.</h4>

       <h1 class="ben3">Becoming the Best Version of Myself Í®ÑÔ∏éÀö ö‚ô°…ûÀöÍ®ÑÔ∏é</h1>
       <h4 class="aboutben3"> Although I wasn't always the best person I learned to grow from my past and learn from my mistakes. I still have some learning and healing to do but I am happy with the progress I have made. I put the effort into changing and doing better for myself. I am satisifed with the outcome and I continue on choosing what's best for me and my mental well being. It took a lot of healing and self reflecting in order to change my attitude and the way I reacted to things. I was tired of being so mad at the world all the time. I learned that not everything needs a response and some times no response is the best response.   </h4>
