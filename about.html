        <h2 class="whyAbout">My Why 🦋🌸𓍯🌸🧸</h2>
        <h4 class="whyAbout1"> My name is Natalia Cardona and I am a senior at Weber Institute. In order to graduate we had to create a project based from our academy. I am in enrolled in the technology academy so I decided to create a website. For a while I sturggled with my mental health. My purpose of creating this website was to inform and assist others that are struggling. I want users to use my blog for resources and techniques to better their well being. </h4>

        <h2 class="whyAbout2"> A Guide to Self Care 🌱📼📖</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutWebsite"> For my website I used a free application called Visual Studio Code to code my website. I have never designed or even coded on my own before this so I had a lot of doubts. I had lots of help from my mentor, Ms. Ceja and my cousin Angel who has lots of experience with coding. They were very helpful and answered all my questions. I went through a lot of bumps while makinhg my website. One of the main one being that I had limited time. I procastinated a lot which means I had to rush my website. Another thing I was struggling with was coding at home. I was doing most of the work at school so it was hard to transfer all my code to when I wanted to work at home.  </h4>

        <h2 class="aboutLessons">Lessons ⋆꙳•̩̩͙❅*̩ ⋆</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutLessons1">Throughout my project I feel like I obtained many valuable lessons. I learned that I am capable of anything I put my mind to. If I really wanted to do something, I could. I have all the resources I need to do anything I want. I was very determined to complete this project and I had a lot of doubts when I first started. I pushed myself and tried my best and I am super happy that I did. It wasn't easy but the feeling of my hard work paying off feels great. If I were to do my website over, I would definitely begin coding earlier. I was under the assumption that it wouldn’t take a lot of time but I was wrong. I wouldn’t have procrastinated as much as I did and do a lot more research on how to code and how to style my website. 
        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <h2 class="whyAbout3">Obstacles ࿐ ࿔*:･ﾟ</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutObstacles"> There were many obstacles in this project for me. I procrastinate a lot and I was quite lazy. I also work so it was hard to balance my website, regular school assignments, and then having a job on top of that. After school I would go straight to work then come home and work on my project. Although it was hard and draining, I am very happy that I was able to complete it.</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h2 class="overall"> Reflection ꒰ঌ ໒꒱</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="aboutOverall"> Overall I feel happy with my completed project. I'm happy I was able to pull it off as well as handling my other school work. I hope that my blog can help others with their self care journey. If i were to give advice to someone about life i’d say to do the most you can. When I was younger I always thought how my life would be as a teenager. Now i’m living through my teenage years and I wish I would’ve done more back then. I wish I went out more, took risks, and just live my life to the fullest. It’s okay to have fun and life your life. There is so much in life then what we know. Always choose yourself and never be scared to do whats best for you.  With that being said here is a quote from one of my favorite artist, Mac Miller "You could have the world in the palm of your hand, but it don't mean a thing 'til you change it."</h4>
